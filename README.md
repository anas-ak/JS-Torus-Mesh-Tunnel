# JS-Torus-Mesh-Tunnel

<img src="torusTunnel.gif" />

<p>
  This is my first serious attempt at breaking down how THREE.JS works. <br />
  We create a camera which serves as the projection mode designed to mimic the way the human eye sees objects. <br />
  Then we create a Three Scene. NormalMaterial maps the normal vectors to RGB colors <br />
  We create a class representing triangular polygon mesh based objects (class for generating torus geometries)
